# Covid-19 Data Analysis Project

This project analyzes Covid-19 data using Python, Pandas, and Seaborn. The analysis covers data cleaning, aggregation, feature engineering, and visualization to extract insights from the Covid-19 dataset.

## Project Structure

- `covid_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing all data analysis steps, code, and visualizations.
- `covid_Data.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.

## Features

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Aggregation and groupby operations
- Feature engineering (e.g., ratio of deaths to cases)
- Data visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- jupyter (optional, for running the notebook)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Install the required Python packages:
   ```sh
   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn jupyter
   ```
3. Open `covid_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
4. Run the notebook cells to reproduce the analysis.

## Data Source

The dataset (`covid_Data.csv`) contains columns such as:
- continent
- location
- date
- total_cases
- total_deaths
- gdp_per_capita
- human_development_index

## Visualizations

The notebook includes:
- Histograms
- Bar plots
- Scatter plots
- Pair plots
